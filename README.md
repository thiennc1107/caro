# Tic-Tac-Toe-Using-Alpha-Beta-Minimax-Search

This code demonstrates the use of Alpha Beta Pruning for Game playing. Since, Tic Tac Toe has a depth of 9 , I use a heuristic function that evaluates the Board State after searching through a depth of 3. The heuristic function calculates the expected score of winning for the PC given the board state.
